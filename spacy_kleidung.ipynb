Prediction=> 0\n",
      "At first i was interested. i liked the color, the soft tencel fabric, the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back. \n",

Prediction=> 1\n",
      "Excited to get this sweater! i'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i don't like clingy sweaters. this was perfect; fitted but not tight. i'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date. wish i could've gotten it for the 25% off + free s/h but glad i didn't wait - this size was sold out first.

Prediction=> 1\n",

      "I was lucky enough to get these on sale with an additional 40% off, making them a fabulous deal. they are nicely made, and the shade of blue is very pretty. my only complaint, and the reason i'm on the fence is that they are so big. i usually buy a 31 in the ag stevie jeans, occasionally a 32, so i figured i'd be safe sizing down to a 30. wrong. i could have gone to a 29, and possibly even a 28....they're that big! i do like them though, and may just try shrinking them in the dryer. Prediction=> 1\n",
      "I would have loved this tee but the color didn't love me. it's sort of a mustard orange. the embroidery is beautifully done but i felt the size of the yarn tassels were too big and looked a bit odd, but i have a large bust so don't like to draw attention there. it's a sweatshirt and not a tee shirt, but it flows and doesn't grab anywhere. it looked so nice under a jean jacket. if it weren't for the color and tassels, it would be a keeper for me.

      "A cute dress, though waist a little too high (more of an empire waist... hitting at widest part of rib cage). this looks like it should be a stretchy knit dress, but the detailing has no give whatsoever and the dress runs quite small. i usually wear a 00, but though i could get it zipped, it wasn't comfortable, and if i want to keep it, i'll need to size up to a 0. i'm 5'6\", 32b-24-35.

Prediction=> 1\n",
