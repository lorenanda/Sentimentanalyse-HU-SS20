      "I love the concept, and it fit nice and looked cozy yet a bit sexy. however, the material was a tiny bit scratchy and warm. so with no long sleeves, you would have to wear a sweater or something on top and i was looking for a simple one piece. i would have loved this and not returned it if the fabric was soft. it should be, it's all about being cozy.

      "Love the fabric and design of this dress, very unique and comfortable. it is not lined, which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses. i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely. the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight. the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but we're not uncomfortable. they define the waist very well. i am 5'7'',127lbs, athletic build and the 4 fit Prediction=> 1\n",

      "I love this top! although, i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium. i am 5'4\", 138 pounds and a 34d. the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders. it will work; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home.

      "I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out. \n",

      "Great top to dress (further) up or down. it does, however, run large and the straps seem (too) long. if you are a petite you will not be able to wear a regular without alterations. Prediction=> 1\n",
      "These are great pants! i sized up from my typical size 28 because i found the rise to be a little low for me. i tend to like my pants a little higher on my waist. the sa said these ran a little smaller for most. when i got home, i put them up to my size 28's and they were the same.

      "I loved the colors (especially the pink) and thought this would be really pretty. however, when i received it, its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it. i also found it huge. normally, i wear an xxsp or a 00p (for reference i am 5'2, 30e and 24 in waist. i tried both the xxsp (fit better but was too short) and the xxs (too large). i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted, but its definitely not.

      "I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.

      "I bought this dress to wear for our upcoming family pictures. i don&#39;t think the image does the dress justice - the fit is so flattering and slimming. i feel like it can easily be dressed down too, with a cute jacket in either denim or leather. the material is thinner, and it does wrinkle a bit. the price tag is a tad high also for a thin maxi dress, but i just had to have it. :) Prediction=> 1\n",

Prediction=> 1\n",
      "I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews, i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately, it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest, and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.

      "I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.

Prediction=> 0\n",
      "So hard to guess fit and size so because i carry my weight in my tummy i ordered an xl. they were too big. the waistband is a nice, very wide, comfy elastic but fit loose. the legs were a bit baggy too and too long for my frame. the fabric is soft and has a bit of a contrast down the sides of the leg. due to the length, i decided not to reorder a smaller size. i think you'd be safe to size down in these.
